# Bootstrap-Fullsite
This project is a full site created using the Bootstrap library.

I implemented new styling to the existing framework to make a visually appealing and elegant design.

This is solely an HTML and CSS project, there is no functionality in the buttons and no external linking to other content. 

Creating thsi project helped me get familiar with the multitude of components available in the Bootstrap repository such as:
-Carousels
-Background Images
-Buttons and Options
-Navigation bars
-Cards

Please take a look at.
